# HTMA: A simple way to create static sites

## What is HTMA? 

*HTML Template and Markdown Automator*, or HTMA, is a simple static page generator programmed in Python, which aims to facilitate the integration of markdown formatted documents, as well as all types of files, into HTML. 

## Why HTMA?

There are very commendable options on the software market that do the same job as HTMA, and because they are more popular - and better - they receive ongoing maintenance that this project lacks due to its personal nature. Some of these alternatives include:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)

While the problem with the above-linked programs is their **complexity**. They all have a long list of overwhelming features, a virtue turned flaw, which tends to make it difficult for novice users to create templates. 

If you already have a web page previously written in HTML, you may have to reformulate much of its structure to suit the frameworks that will automate it. But with HTMA *no more than a couple of blocks of code embedded in HTML* will be enough to achieve the same goal.

In this guide, you can learn all the details of the tool in thirty minutes.
