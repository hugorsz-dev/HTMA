# Working environment

## Operating system

HTMA runs on any operating system, as long as it is able to run *Python 3*. The script will run successfully on Microsoft Windows as well as on *Unix-like* systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, GNU-Linux...).

## Python version

HTMA has been programmed in *Python 3*, so it will be essential to run the program from a compatible version. 

If you have doubts about the version of Python installed on your computer, run: 

```
python --version
```

## Dependencies

All modules used by the HTMA script are standard, with the exception of the [markdown parser](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/?tab=readme-ov-file). Installing them is as simple as running the following ``pip` command:

```
pip install markdown2
```
